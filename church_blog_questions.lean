-- Church numerals

-- Another way of doing nat.

-- The church nat, chℕ (happy to change the name) is a pi type
-- and not a structure. So proofs are not done by induction!

-- it is almost as if the structure ℕ were built to be fed into chℕ 
-- Why does this happen? KB doesn't understand

-- that definition needs to be moved if we can't prove functoriality wrt succ

example : to_nat c3 = 3 := rfl 

-- exercise: define succ
def succ :chℕ → chℕ := λ n X f x, f (n X f x) -- KB can do this one
-- no notation

--unit tests -- KB can pass these
example : succ c0 = c1 := rfl

example (n : ℕ) : of_nat (nat.succ n) = succ (of_nat n) := rfl

--KB can't do this one. Is it unprovable? If so, move definition of to_nat much further down.
example (m : chℕ) : to_nat (succ m) = nat.succ (to_nat m) := rfl
--Kenny can do this one, lol.

-- exercise : define add

  (λ m_ih n f, n

-- composed with itself Ack(m,n) times, but I need
-- to convert it to a church numeral in "sorry".

    (λ n_ih x, f (n_ih x))
    (λ x, f x))
  (n (X → X)) -- KB didn't try this one
-- Is it possible?
-- Kenny : I don't think it is possible, since you need to
-- recursively build a Type 1 function, whereas chℕ only
-- permits recursion on Type 0 stuff.

-- if it's possible, prove it agrees with usual ackermnann
-- example : ack m n = ack (of_nat m) (of_nat n) := sorry

-- question : Is this provable? KB couldn't do this one
theorem add_comm (m n : chℕ) : m + n = n + m := sorry 

-- KB thinks this might be chℕ's free theorem
-- KB can't prove it
